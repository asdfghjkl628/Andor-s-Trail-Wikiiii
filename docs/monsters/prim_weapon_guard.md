## Dialogue simulator

Set the quest stages, items and other conditions that apply to your game, then start the conversation with Prim weapon guard. The simulator applies the game's own rules: it performs the same silent checks, offers only the options that would be shown in the game, and applies their effects (quest stages, items handed over, rewards) as the conversation proceeds.

??? info "How the XP value is calculated"

    The game computes each enemy's experience value when it loads the data (`MonsterTypeParser.java`):

    XP = ⌈(attacks per turn × attack chance × average damage × (1 + critical skill × critical multiplier) × 3 + HP × (1 + block chance) + 9 × damage resistance) × 0.7⌉

    Percentages are used as fractions (e.g. 60% = 0.6). Enemies whose attacks inflict a condition are worth 50 XP more. The More Exp skill adds a percentage on top.
