| Damage | 2 to 7 |
| Attack chance | 85 |
| Block chance | 165 |

**On hit:** On target: Insect contagion (magnitude 6, 5 rounds, 70% chance); Blistering skin (magnitude 5, 5 rounds, 50% chance)

**XP formula** (from the game's loader): ⌈(attacks per turn × attack chance × average damage × (1 + critical skill × multiplier) × 3 + HP × (1 + block chance) + 9 × damage resistance) × 0.7⌉, +50 if its hits inflict a condition. More Exp adds a percentage on top.
