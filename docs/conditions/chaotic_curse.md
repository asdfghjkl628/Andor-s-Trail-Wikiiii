| **Type** | Harmful |
| **Category** | [Mental](index.md#categories-and-resistance) |

## Effects

| Effect | Per magnitude level |
|---|---|
| Max AP | −1 |
| Attack damage | −1 |
| Block chance | −10 |
| Damage resistance | −1 |

All values are multiplied by the condition's magnitude. Round effects apply once per round: each turn in combat, and every 6 seconds outside combat.

**Stacking:** No. A new application replaces the current one only if it has a higher magnitude, or the same magnitude and a longer duration.

## How you get it

**Enemies**

| Enemy | When | Magnitude | Duration | Chance | Found in |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Iqhan chaos enslaver](../monsters/iqhan_boss.md) | When it hits you | 3 | 5 rounds | 50% | pwcave4 |
| [Madame Mim](../monsters/swamp_witch.md) | When it hits you | 1 | 2 rounds | 50% | swamp_hut |


<p class="verified">Verified against v0.8.18 item, monster, dialogue and skill data.</p>

## Removal and protection

- **Resistance:** each level of [Strong Mind](../skills/resistanceMental.md) reduces the chance of receiving this condition by 10% of its value (for example, a 30% chance becomes 27% at level 1). Effects with a 100% chance cannot be resisted.
- **[Dark blessing of the Shadow](../skills/shadowBless.md)** reduces the chance of receiving any condition by 5% of its value per level.
- **[Rejuvenation](../skills/rejuvenation.md):** each round, a 20% chance per skill level to reduce the magnitude of one random timed harmful condition by 1.
- **Duration and rest:** timed applications end when their duration runs out, and resting removes them earlier.
