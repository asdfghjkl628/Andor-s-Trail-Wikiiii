## Dialogue simulator

Set the quest stages, items and other conditions that apply to your game, then start the conversation with Bearded citizen. The simulator applies the game's own rules: it performs the same silent checks, offers only the options that would be shown in the game, and applies their effects (quest stages, items handed over, rewards) as the conversation proceeds.
