## Dialogue simulator

Set up your situation (quest stages, items, kills…), then talk to Oromir. The simulator follows the game's own rules: it takes the same silent checks, offers only the options you'd really see, and applies their effects (quest stages, items handed over, rewards) as you go.

<p class="verified">Rules verified against v0.8.18 game code (ConversationController.java) and dialogue data.</p>
