## Combat stats

| Stat | Value |
|---|---|
| HP | 251 |
| Damage | 15 to 20 |
| Attack chance | 177 |
| Block chance | 153 |

| Attacks per turn | 3 |
| Move cost | 3 AP |

**XP formula** (from the game's loader): ⌈(attacks per turn × attack chance × average damage × (1 + critical skill × multiplier) × 3 + HP × (1 + block chance) + 9 × damage resistance) × 0.7⌉, +50 if its hits inflict a condition. More Exp adds a percentage on top.
