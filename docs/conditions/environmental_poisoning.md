## How you get it

**Dialogue and scripted events**

| From | Quest | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| stepping on a trigger on [Korhald cave outdoor 1](../maps/korhald_cave_outdoor1.md), stepping on a trigger on [Waterway 10](../maps/waterway10.md) | – | 1 round |


<p class="verified">Verified against v0.8.18 item, monster, dialogue and skill data.</p>

## Removal and protection

- **[Rejuvenation](../skills/rejuvenation.md):** each round, a 20% chance per round to weaken one timed harmful condition by 1.
- **Duration and rest:** timed ones wear off, or rest them away.
