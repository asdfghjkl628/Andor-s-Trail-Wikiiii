## Behind the scenes

*How the game data handles this character. Not needed for playing.*

??? info "How the XP value is calculated"

    The game computes each enemy's experience value when it loads the data (`MonsterTypeParser.java`):

    XP = ⌈(attacks per turn × attack chance × average damage × (1 + critical skill × critical multiplier) × 3 + HP × (1 + block chance) + 9 × damage resistance) × 0.7⌉

    Percentages are used as fractions (e.g. 60% = 0.6). Enemies whose attacks inflict a condition are worth 50 XP more. The More Exp skill adds a percentage on top.
