!!! note "Immune to critical hits"
    Ghosts, constructs and demons can't be critically hit. Your crit build will have to sit this one out.

**XP formula** (from the game's loader): ⌈(attacks per turn × attack chance × average damage × (1 + critical skill × multiplier) × 3 + HP × (1 + block chance) + 9 × damage resistance) × 0.7⌉, +50 if its hits inflict a condition. More Exp adds a percentage on top.
