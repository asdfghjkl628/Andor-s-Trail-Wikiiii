## Dialogue simulator

Set up your situation (quest stages, items, kills…), then talk to Laurenz. The simulator follows the game's own rules: it takes the same silent checks, offers only the options you'd really see, and applies their effects (quest stages, items handed over, rewards) as you go.

<p class="verified">Rules verified against v0.8.18 game code (ConversationController.java) and dialogue data.</p>

    <span id="d-brightport_student_2"></span>**`brightport_student_2`** [Laurenz](../monsters/brightportstudent10.md): “I would rather work on these terrible assignments than be in that Feygard professor's history class.”

    - “Can you tell me who this professor is?” → [brightport_student_2_reply](#d-brightport_student_2_reply)

    <span id="d-brightport_student_2_reply"></span>**`brightport_student_2_reply`** [Laurenz](../monsters/brightportstudent10.md): “His name is Frederich. He was sent here as a teacher after Lord Geomyr took the throne. Though that was long before I came here. I only heard about it from my upperclassmen.”

    - Next → [brightport_student_2_reply1](#d-brightport_student_2_reply1)

    <span id="d-brightport_student_2_reply1"></span>**`brightport_student_2_reply1`** [Laurenz](../monsters/brightportstudent10.md): “If those Feygard folk are anything like him, you'd better steer clear.”

    - “Hmph, another peasant who doesn't understand the glory of Feygard.” → *conversation ends*
    - “Thanks. Shadow be with you.” → *conversation ends*
