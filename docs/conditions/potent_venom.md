*Harmful blood condition.*

|---|---|
| **Type** | Harmful |
| **Category** | [Blood](index.md#categories-and-resistance) |
| **Affects** | You |
| **Stacking** | Yes |
| **Resisted by** | [Pure Blood](../skills/resistanceBlood.md) |
| **Condition ID** | `potent_venom` |

</div>

## Effects

| Effect | Per magnitude level |
|---|---|
| Max HP | −3 |
| Move cost (AP) | +1 |
| HP every round | −3 to −2 |

All values are multiplied by the condition's magnitude. Round effects apply once per round: each turn in combat, and every 6 seconds outside combat.

**Stacking:** Yes. A second application with the same duration adds its magnitude to the existing one; one with a different duration is kept as a separate instance.

## How you get it

**Enemies**

| Enemy | When | Magnitude | Duration | Chance | Found in |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Venomous swamp creature](../monsters/venomous_swamp_creature.md) | When it hits you | 1 | 3 rounds | 15% | galmore_28 |


<p class="verified">Verified against v0.8.18 item, monster, dialogue and skill data.</p>

## Removal and protection

- **Resistance:** each level of [Pure Blood](../skills/resistanceBlood.md) reduces the chance of receiving this condition by 10% of its value (for example, a 30% chance becomes 27% at level 1). Effects with a 100% chance cannot be resisted.
- **[Dark blessing of the Shadow](../skills/shadowBless.md)** reduces the chance of receiving any condition by 5% of its value per level.
- **[Rejuvenation](../skills/rejuvenation.md):** each round, a 20% chance per skill level to reduce the magnitude of one random timed harmful condition by 1.
- **Duration and rest:** timed applications end when their duration runs out, and resting removes them earlier.
