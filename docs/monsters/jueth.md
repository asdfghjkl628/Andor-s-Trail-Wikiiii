## Dialogue simulator

Set up your situation (quest stages, items, kills…), then talk to Jueth. The simulator follows the game's own rules: it takes the same silent checks, offers only the options you'd really see, and applies their effects (quest stages, items handed over, rewards) as you go.

<div class="dlg-sim" data-src="../../assets/dialogue/prim_tailor.json" data-npc="Jueth" markdown="0"><noscript>The simulator needs JavaScript. The full dialogue is listed below.</noscript></div>

<p class="verified">Rules verified against v0.8.18 game code (ConversationController.java) and dialogue data.</p>

    <span id="d-prim_tailor_1"></span>**`prim_tailor_1`** Jueth: “Sell? I'm sorry, my supplies are all out. Now that the traders do not come here anymore, I don't get my regular shipments. So at the moment, I have nothing to trade with you unfortunately.”


    <span id="d-prim_tailor_2"></span>**`prim_tailor_2`** Jueth: “I have heard about an accident, yes, but I've been very busy lately.”

    - “Busy? You're out of stock!” → [prim_tailor_3](#d-prim_tailor_3)
    - “OK, thanks anyway.” → *conversation ends*

    <span id="d-prim_tailor_3"></span>**`prim_tailor_3`** Jueth: “*Staring at you comptemptuously* I also take various repair orders, kid. Now get out of my shop.”
