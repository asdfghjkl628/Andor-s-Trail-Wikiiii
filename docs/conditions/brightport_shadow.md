> A master rogue glides through the shadows as if dancing.

## Effects

| Effect | Per magnitude level |
|---|---|
| Attack chance | +11 |
| Attack damage | +3 |
| Block chance | −6 |

Values are per magnitude level. A round is one combat turn, or 6 seconds outside combat.

**Stacking:** No (only a stronger or longer application replaces it).


<p class="verified">Verified against v0.8.18 condition data and game code (`ActorStatsController.java`).</p>

## How you get it

**Items**

| Item | When | Magnitude | Duration | Chance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Agent's cloak](../items/brightport_cloak.md) | When an attack misses you | 1 | 2 rounds | 40% |


<p class="verified">Verified against v0.8.18 item, monster, dialogue and skill data.</p>

## Removal and protection

- **Resistance:** [Enduring Body](../skills/resistancePhysical.md), −10% of the chance per level (30% → 27% at level 1). 100% chances can't be resisted. Yes, it also lowers your chance of getting this *beneficial* one.
- **[Dark blessing of the Shadow](../skills/shadowBless.md)** −5% of the chance for any condition.
- **Duration and rest:** timed ones wear off, or rest them away.
