## Effects

| Effect | Per magnitude level |
|---|---|
| Attack chance | +10 |
| Block chance | +10 |

All values are multiplied by the condition's magnitude. Round effects apply once per round: each turn in combat, and every 6 seconds outside combat.

**Stacking:** No. A new application replaces the current one only if it has a higher magnitude, or the same magnitude and a longer duration.

## How you get it

**Items**

| Item | When | Magnitude | Duration | Chance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Helm of Foreseeing](../items/Helm_foreseeing.md) | When you defeat an enemy | 2 | 4 rounds | 15% |


<p class="verified">Verified against v0.8.18 item, monster, dialogue and skill data.</p>

## Removal and protection

- **Resistance:** each level of [Strong Mind](../skills/resistanceMental.md) reduces the chance of receiving this condition by 10% of its value (for example, a 30% chance becomes 27% at level 1). Effects with a 100% chance cannot be resisted. Note that resistance also applies to beneficial conditions: it lowers the chance of receiving this one from sources with a chance below 100%.
- **[Dark blessing of the Shadow](../skills/shadowBless.md)** reduces the chance of receiving any condition by 5% of its value per level.
- **Duration and rest:** timed applications end when their duration runs out, and resting removes them earlier.
