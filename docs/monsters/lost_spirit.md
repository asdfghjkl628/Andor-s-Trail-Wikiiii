## Dialogue simulator

Set the quest stages, items and other conditions that apply to your game, then start the conversation with Lost spirit. The simulator applies the game's own rules: it performs the same silent checks, offers only the options that would be shown in the game, and applies their effects (quest stages, items handed over, rewards) as the conversation proceeds.

    ```


??? info "How the XP value is calculated"

    The game computes each enemy's experience value when it loads the data (`MonsterTypeParser.java`):

    XP = ⌈(attacks per turn × attack chance × average damage × (1 + critical skill × critical multiplier) × 3 + HP × (1 + block chance) + 9 × damage resistance) × 0.7⌉

    Percentages are used as fractions (e.g. 60% = 0.6). Enemies whose attacks inflict a condition are worth 50 XP more. The More Exp skill adds a percentage on top.
