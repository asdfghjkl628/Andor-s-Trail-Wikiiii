## Behind the scenes

*How the game data handles this character. Not needed for playing.*

- `blackwater_guard` belongs to the faction `fct_bwm`. The game treats any character as hostile once your standing with its faction is below zero.

??? info "How the XP value is calculated"

    The game computes each enemy's experience value when it loads the data (`MonsterTypeParser.java`):

    XP = ⌈(attacks per turn × attack chance × average damage × (1 + critical skill × critical multiplier) × 3 + HP × (1 + block chance) + 9 × damage resistance) × 0.7⌉

    Percentages are used as fractions (e.g. 60% = 0.6). Enemies whose attacks inflict a condition are worth 50 XP more. The More Exp skill adds a percentage on top.
