## Effects

| Effect | Per magnitude level |
|---|---|
| HP every round | −1 |

All values are multiplied by the condition's magnitude. Round effects apply once per round: each turn in combat, and every 6 seconds outside combat.

**Stacking:** No. A new application replaces the current one only if it has a higher magnitude, or the same magnitude and a longer duration.


<p class="verified">Verified against v0.8.18 condition data and game code (`ActorStatsController.java`).</p>

## How you get it

**Items**

| Item | When | Magnitude | Duration | Chance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Cake](../items/cake.md) | When used | 2 | 20 rounds | 100% |


<p class="verified">Verified against v0.8.18 item, monster, dialogue and skill data.</p>

## Removal and protection

- **[Rejuvenation](../skills/rejuvenation.md):** each round, a 20% chance per skill level to reduce the magnitude of one random timed harmful condition by 1.
- **Duration and rest:** timed applications end when their duration runs out, and resting removes them earlier.
