## Behind the scenes

*How the game data handles this character. Not needed for playing.*

**2 entries.** The game data defines 2 separate characters named Shepherd's dog. The game makes a new entry whenever a character needs different behaviour (another conversation later in a quest, another place, other stats). Some are the same person at different points in the story; others just share a generic name.
