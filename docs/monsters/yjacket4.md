**On hit:** On target: Minor sting (magnitude 2, 5 rounds, 30% chance)

**XP formula** (from the game's loader): ⌈(attacks per turn × attack chance × average damage × (1 + critical skill × multiplier) × 3 + HP × (1 + block chance) + 9 × damage resistance) × 0.7⌉, +50 if its hits inflict a condition. More Exp adds a percentage on top.
