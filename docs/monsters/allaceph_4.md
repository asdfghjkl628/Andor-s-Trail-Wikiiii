## Combat stats

| Stat | Value |
|---|---|
| HP | 111 |
| Damage | 3 to 7 |
| Attack chance | 80 |
| Block chance | 110 |
| Damage resistance | 2 |
| Max AP | 10 |
| Attack cost | 3 AP |
| Attacks per turn | 3 |
| Move cost | 5 AP |
| Critical skill | 40 |
| Critical multiplier | 2.0 |
| Crit chance | 23% |

!!! note "Immune to critical hits"
    Ghosts, constructs and demons can't be critically hit. Your crit build will have to sit this one out.

**On hit:** Heal HP: 4; On target: Minor weapon feebleness (magnitude 3, 3 rounds, 20% chance)

**XP formula** (from the game's loader): ⌈(attacks per turn × attack chance × average damage × (1 + critical skill × multiplier) × 3 + HP × (1 + block chance) + 9 × damage resistance) × 0.7⌉, +50 if its hits inflict a condition. More Exp adds a percentage on top.
