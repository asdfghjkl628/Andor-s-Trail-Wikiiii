## Dialogue simulator

Talk to Elvira as you would in the game. When the conversation depends on your progress (a quest, an item, a dice roll…), the simulator asks you. Try another answer with **Undo**.

<div class="dlg-sim" data-src="../../assets/dialogue/brightport_inn.json" data-npc="Elvira" markdown="0"><noscript>The simulator needs JavaScript. The full dialogue is listed below.</noscript></div>

<p class="verified">Follows the game's own conversation rules (v0.8.18).</p>

??? quote "Dialogue (2 lines)"

    *Exactly as in the game files. Each line appears once; links jump to where a choice leads.*

    <span id="d-brightport_inn"></span>**`brightport_inn`** [Elvira](../monsters/brightportinn.md): “Welcome! Is there something I can help you with?”

    - “Could I rent a place to rest?” → [brightport_inn2](#d-brightport_inn2)
    - “Never mind.” → *conversation ends*

    <span id="d-brightport_inn2"></span>**`brightport_inn2`** [Elvira](../monsters/brightportinn.md): “I'm sorry, at this time of the year we get a lot of visitors, and all the beds are occupied.”

    - “That's too bad, it seems like a lovely place.” → *conversation ends*
